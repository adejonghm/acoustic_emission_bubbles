## Description

In this repository you can find different Notebooks developed in Jupyter along with some other scripts.

#### Jupyter Notebook
- *bubble_simulation.ipynb*: This notebook is used for the simulation of the acoustic signal emission of a bubble in liquid media using the mathematical model proposed by Strasberg [1].
- *frame_separator*: This notebook is used to separate a video, frame by frame, to obtain information from a video, such as frame rate, number of frames and duration of the video, and can also be used to separate multiple videos, frame by frame, which is found within the same folder.
#### Other Scripts
In the folder called "some_scripts", there are some scripts that can be used to rename files, create a .cmd file that is used to rename, among others.

#### Technologies
