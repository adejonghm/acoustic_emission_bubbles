Repository to control versions of my code developed in my master's degree.

The following notebooks are found in the master branch:
1. bubble_simulation: This notebook is the simulation of a acoustic signal emission of a bubble in liquid using the model of Strasberg.
2. frame_separator: This notebook is to separate a video, frame by frame. Within this notebook, you can find some information such as where frames are stored.
